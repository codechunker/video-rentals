# Read Me First
This is a Video Rental Application to enable a company that displays a list of available movies from a database and calculates video rental fees for a movie selected from the list.

# Getting Started
The application was compiled with JDK 1.8. In order to run the jar, simply download the [zip file](https://github.com/codechunker/video-rentals/blob/main/video-rentals.zip)  and run the command below and you are good to go - just make sure you have Java
running on your system.
 ```
java -jar video-rentals.jar
```

The application runs on port 8097 but of course you can change the port in the ***application.properties*** file in the config folder.
### Reference Documentation
The documentation for the project can be found on http://localhost:8097/swagger-ui.html once the application is running. Sample Image is shown below:
